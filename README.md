# Browser Style Override
The goal of this project is to provide an updated version of the default browser styles used by extensions in Firefox. The builtin stylesheet is dated and no longer reflects the current Firefox Photon appearance.

This stylesheet is designed to be a replacement for the built-in Firefox browser style. Using these styles requires similar HTML code to the default browser styles.
